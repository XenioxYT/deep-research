Tejo enjoys widespread popularity in Colombia, second only to soccer in terms of its supported industry [1]. It is considered a connection to the pre-Columbian era, representing a cultural link between Colombia's past and present [1][2]. The game is commonly played in both major cities and smaller towns, with professional teams existing throughout the country [1]. -> WORKS

Traditionally, Tejo was associated with *chicha*, an indigenous maize-based alcoholic beverage [1]. However, in modern times, beer has become the drink of choice for many Tejo players [1]. This close association with beer has led to significant involvement from beer companies, which often sponsor Tejo teams and tournaments [1]. This commercialization has sparked some controversy, with some Colombians advocating for a separation of alcohol and the sport, aiming to reframe Tejo's image from a rowdy bar game to a serious sport with a rich history [1]. -> DOESNT WORK

probably something to do with ** or something as it always seems to occur when italics or bold text is used within the markdown.
